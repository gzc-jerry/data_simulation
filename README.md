## 1.Roulette Simulation Game
An American roulette game simulation game for fun

American roulette uses a wheel with 38 pockets: 18 red, 18 black, and 2 green. The pockets are labeled with the numbers 1–36 (inclusive), one 0 pocket, and one 00 pocket. You decide to make a bet of $10 on the first dozen numbers (1–12, inclusive). If you win, you get your initial bet returned plus $20 as profit.

This code simulates a roulette game for 10000 times and see the simulated win rate and profit.
